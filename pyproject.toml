description = "I needed to automate the process of generating images and could not find any straightforward ready-made solutions for this purpose. Hence, I developed my own solution. The primary idea is to replicate and expand Forge's functionality: specifically, the "Prompts from file or textbox script". This will allow you to easily combine pre-prepared lists of prompts, LoRA, styles, allowing you to combine texts as you wish. The resulting images prompt in metadata must be compatible with Forge, ideally appearing no different than those generated by it. However, I encountered a problem because Forge uses the internal name from the LoRA file metadata as the LoRA's name instead of the filename. Consequently, all existing solutions failed to comprehend my templates. I also wish for the ability to write LoRA in any order and quantity within a text file using this format: <lora:name:1.0> or <lora:name:unet=1.0:te=0.75>. This should be automatically applied without the need to create separate nodes for each LoRA. Additionally, I would like it if the CivitAI platform could understand metadata. As the closest solution I found was the alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver project. However, this alternative loses LORA written in Forge style by using the internal name instead of the filename."
